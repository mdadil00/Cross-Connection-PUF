## Introduction
Welcome to the Cross Connection PUF Project! This project aims to predict the output response for the Cross-Connection Puf using a binary classifier Logistic Regression model. By analyzing various features, the model can predict the correct output of COCO-PUF.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using Logistic Regression to predict the response generated by Coco Pufs. This model helps understand which features are most significant in predicting customer choices and can aid in targeted marketing strategies.


## Model
The model used in this project is a Logistic Regression classifier, which is suitable for binary classification tasks. Logistic Regression predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class (e.g., preference for Coco Pufs).

### Model Pipeline
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. **Feature Selection**: Select the most relevant features for prediction.
3. **Model Training**: Train the Logistic Regression model on the training dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict customer preferences.

### Model Parameters
- **Regularization**: L2 (Ridge) regularization to avoid overfitting.
- **Solver**: 'liblinear' for small datasets and binary classification.
- **Threshold**: Decision threshold set to 0.5 for binary classification.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/coco-pufs-project.git
    cd coco-pufs-project
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure that your dataset is in the `data` directory.
2. Open the given .py file:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open `submit.py` and run to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
4. Make Predictions:
    Use the provided script to make predictions on new customer data:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input data/new_customers.csv --output results/predictions.csv
    ```
    **Parameters**:
    - `--input`: Path to the new customer data file.
    - `--output`: Path to save the prediction results.

## Results

### Model Performance
The Logistic Regression model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:
- Accuracy: 99.8% for Response1 and 98.8% for Response0

The model shows good performance in predicting the output of PUF.
